# Foodifai-iOS
Foodifai for iOS is my hack from HackNY Spring 2016! It allows the user to submit a photo of food to find restaurants that serve food similar to what is shown. Then, the user can request an Uber to pick them up from within the app.

## API's Used
### Clarifai: Once a photo is submitted, it is sent to Clarifai's new food model endpoint in order to retreive tags related to the photo.
### Foursquare: Foursquare's API is used to find restaurants related to the top tags generated by Clarifai. They are then displayed in a table and the user can quickly view important information about the restaurant.
### Button: When the user views a restaurant's details, they will have the option to request an Uber to pick them up and take them to the restaurant. The Button API allows an Uber deep-linked button to be displayed directly within the app, giving the user a seamless experience.
